<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is a three-terminal electronic device made of semiconductor material that is used to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power. It consists of two p-n junctions formed by combining p-type and n-type semiconductor materials, which creates three layers of semiconductor material: the emitter layer, the base layer, and the collector layer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The BJT operates by using the flow of current through the base layer to control the flow of current between the emitter and collector layers. When a small current flows through the base terminal, it controls the flow of a larger current between the emitter and collector terminals. This current amplification is what makes the BJT useful as an amplifier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are two types of BJT: the npn transistor and the pnp transistor. The npn transistor has an n-type base layer between two p-type layers (emitter and collector), while the pnp transistor has a p-type base layer between two n-type layers (emitter and collector). The operation of the npn and pnp transistors is similar, but they are used in different ways.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BJTs are widely used in a variety of electronic circuits and devices, such as amplifiers, oscillators, switches, and regulators. They are commonly used in both analog and digital circuits and are found in a wide range of electronic devices, including radios, televisions, computers, and mobile phones.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;BJT WORKING&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A BJT is made up of three layers of semiconductor material, called the emitter, base, and collector. The emitter layer is heavily doped with impurities, making it a good source of electrons. The collector layer is also heavily doped, but with impurities of the opposite type, making it a good sink for electrons. The base layer is lightly doped with impurities and acts as a current-controlled resistor, regulating the flow of electrons between the emitter and collector.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When a voltage is applied to the base terminal, it creates a current that flows through the base layer. This current creates a field that attracts the electrons from the emitter and causes them to flow through the base layer towards the collector. As the electrons flow through the base layer, they combine with the holes (absences of electrons) in the semiconductor material, effectively canceling each other out. This process reduces the resistance of the base layer, allowing more electrons to flow through it and increasing the current flowing between the emitter and collector.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The current flowing between the emitter and collector is controlled by the current flowing through the base layer. By adjusting the base current, the BJT can amplify a signal or switch current on and off, depending on the circuit configuration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The transistor can operate in three different regions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Active region: In the active region, the transistor is in its "on" state and allows current to flow between the emitter and collector. The base current is small compared to the collector and emitter currents, and the transistor acts as an amplifier. This is the region where the transistor is typically used for amplification purposes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Saturation region: In the saturation region, the transistor is also in its "on" state, but the collector current is at its maximum value. The base current is still small compared to the collector current, but the transistor is not acting as an amplifier anymore. This region is typically used when the transistor is used as a switch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Cut-off region: In the cut-off region, the transistor is in its "off" state and does not allow any current to flow between the emitter and collector. The base current is also very small in this region</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Working principle of BJT</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The working principle of a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) involves the flow of current through the three layers of the transistor: the emitter, the base, and the collector. The transistor consists of two p-n junctions, one between the emitter and base and the other between the collector and base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When a voltage is applied to the base terminal, it allows a small current to flow through the base and into the emitter. This small current causes a larger current to flow from the emitter to the collector, resulting in amplification of the original base current.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Working of an NPN transistor:</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An NPN transistor is a type of bipolar junction transistor that uses both electrons and holes as charge carriers. It consists of three layers of semiconductor material, each of which is doped with a different type of impurity. The three layers are called the emitter, the base, and the collector.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The working principle of an NPN transistor involves the flow of current through these three layers. When a voltage is applied to the base terminal, it allows a small current to flow through the base and into the emitter. This small current causes a larger current to flow from the emitter to the collector, resulting in amplification of the original base current.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an NPN transistor, the emitter is doped with a high concentration of electrons (negative carriers), the base is doped with a lower concentration of electrons, and the collector is doped with a high concentration of holes (positive carriers). When the base-emitter junction is forward biased electrons in the emitter are attracted to the base and flow into it, leaving a surplus of holes in the emitter. These surplus holes are then attracted to the collector, which causes a larger current to flow from the emitter to the collector.</p>
